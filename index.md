### Research and Collaborations

My area of research is galaxy formation and evolution and my main specialization is spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. I have always focused on combining the information from real observations with the knowledge from the modeling. To many, SED fitting means deriving stellar masses and maybe star formation rates (SFRs). I push SED fitting to the next level and derive not just these basic parameters, but improve significantly the approach to model the SEDs of galaxies and derive also the formation history of individual galaxies. Since my thesis years, I have been trying to convince the community that modeling the star formation history of galaxies with exponentially declining functions of time is not a sensible choice (other than for very massive galaxies at redshift 0). In some ways, I succeded! Nowadays, the community is developing better and better tools for SED fitting, with more and more realistic ingredients. Pushing on the advances of SED fitting and demonstrating the power of this tool to extract information from any type of observations have been my main contributions to the filed.

**Main papers**  
In Pacifici et al. (2012), my main thesis paper, I provided a better approach to model the SEDs of galaxies using star formation histories from cosmological simulations, to properly reproduce the realistic fluctuations in a galaxy history.  
In Pacifici et al. (2013, and also 2016a and b), I showed how to use a Bayesian approach to derive the star formation histories of individual galaxies.  
In Pacifici et al. (2015), I demonstrated how more realistic models of galaxy SEDs are necessary to reproduce the observed colors of galaxies.  
In Barisic, Pacifici et al. (2020), we show the variety of attenuation curves that can be found in galaxies at redshift about 0.8 with a novel technique that combines high-resolution spectra and photometry.  
In Smith, Pacifici et al. (2019), we use the catalog of local star formation histories we produced in the 2016 paper to explore how environment plays a role in the growth history of galaxies.
